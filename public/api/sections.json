These 1/1 NFTs are built on a 100x100 pixel grid format.\n\nBefore every car is made, Evian researches the wheelbase of the chosen car. This is a perfect indicator to apply correct scale in the Car Collective Universe. He then researches to find the factory colours that came with the car from period, along with wheel colours, interior trims and even any accessories, attachments or body kits. He begins designing the cars with the tyres, finding the right spacing for wheelbase and then building from the ground up."
